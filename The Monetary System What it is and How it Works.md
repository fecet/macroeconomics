#### The Monetary System: What it is and How it Works

**Money** is the stock of assets that can be readily used to make transactions. Its functions including:

1. Medium of exchange
2. store of value
3. unit of account

Money has many forms:

1. **Fiat money**
   - ==has no intrinsic value==
   - example: the paper currency
2. **Commodity money**
   - ==has intrinsic value==
   - example: gold coins

> **Money supply** is the quantity of money available in the economy

> **Monetary policy** is the control over the money supply

Monetary policy is conducted by a country’s **central bank**. To
control the money supply, the Fed(the central bank of the U.S.) uses **open market operations**, the purchase and sale of government bonds. 

The following is some measures of money assets:

| symbol |                       assets included                        | amount($ billions) |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------: |
|  $C$   |                           Currency                           |        1279        |
|  $M1$  | **C** +demand deposits, 
travelers’ checks, 
other checkable deposits |        2988        |
|  $M2$  | **M1** +small time deposits, 
savings deposits, 
money market mutual funds, 
money market deposit accounts |       11846        |

The money supply equals:
$$
M=C+D
$$
where $M$ is money supply, $D$ is demand deposits.

> Reserves(R) is the portion of deposits that banks have not lent.

> A bank’s liabilities include deposits, assets include reserves and outstanding loans.

> **100-percent-reserve banking** is a system in which banks hold all deposits as reserves.

> **Fractional-reserve banking** is a system in which banks hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves. 

For fractional-reserve banking system, suppose we have $\$1000$ deposit:
$$
\begin{aligned} & \text { Orignal deposit } &=\$ 1000 \\+& \text { Firstbank lending } &=\$ 800 \\+& \text { Secondbank lending } &=\$ 640 \\+& \text { Thirdbank lending } &=\$ 512 \\+& \text { other lending... } \end{aligned}
$$
Total money supply is
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (1-rr)^i=\frac{1}{rr}
$$
The process of transfer from savers to borrowers is called as **financial intermediation**

However, a fractional-reserve banking system creates money, but it doesn’t create wealth because bank loans give borrowers some new money and an equal amount of new debt.

> **Bank capital** are the resources a bank’s owners have put into the bank

> **Leverage** is the use of borrowed money to supplement existing funds for purposes of investment.
>
> **Leverage ratio** is defined as $\frac{assets}{bank\ capital}$

When assets decrease $a\%$, the capital decrease $leverage\ ratio \times a\%$.

> **Capital requirement** is §minimum amount of capital mandated by regulators

Capital requirement intended to ensure banks will be able to pay off depositors, and it will be higher for banks that hold more risky assets.
