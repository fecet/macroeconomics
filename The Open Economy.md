#### The Open Economy

> No nation was ever ruined by trade.

In a closed economy, all output is sold domestically, and expenditure is divided into three components: consumption, investment, and government purchases. In an open economy, it also includes exports.

- $C^d$, consumption of domestic g&s
- $I^d$, investment of domestic g&s
- $G^d$, government purchases of domestic g&v
- $X$, exports of domestic g&s

We have a identity:
$$
Y=C^{d}+I^{d}+G^{d}+X
$$
Where the first 3 terms is domestic spending on domestic g&s and the last term is foreign spending on domestic g&s.

Note:
$$
\begin{aligned} C &=C^{d}+C^{f} \\ I &=I^{d}+I^{f} \\ G &=G^{d}+G^{f} \end{aligned}
$$
We substitute these three equations into the identity above:
$$
Y=\left(C-C^{f}\right)+\left(I-f^{f}\right)+\left(G-G^{f}\right)+X
$$
The sum of domestic spending on foreign g&s $\left(C^{f}+I^{f}+G^{f}\right)$ is expenditure on imports $IM$.
$$
Y=C+I+G+X-I M
$$
Defining **net exports** to be $X-IM$, the identity becomes
$$
Y=C+I+G+NX
$$
Subtract $C$ and $G$ from both sides to obtain:
$$
Y-C-G=I+N X
$$
Recall that $Y-C-G$ is national saving $S$:
$$
S-I=NX
$$
$NX$ is also called as **trade balance**, and $S-I$ is **net capital outflow**. Depending on $S-I$, we

- trade surplus if it’s positive
- trade deficit if it’s negative
- balance trade if it’s zero

Consider a **small open economy**, the interest rate in which must equal to the **world interest rate** $r^*$:
$$
r=r^*
$$
Now we build the model of the small open economy, we take three assumptions:

- $Y=\overline{Y}=F(\overline{K}, \overline{L})$

- $C=C(Y-T)$

- $I=I(r)$

Therefore, we obtain:
$$
NX=\overline{S}-I(r^*)
$$


The **nominal exchange rate** is the relative price of the currencies of two countries.

A rise in the exchange rate—say, from 80 to 100 yen per dollar—is called an **appreciation** of the dollar; a fall in the exchange rate is called a **depreciation**. When the domestic currency appreciates, it buys more of the foreign currency; when it depreciates, it buys less. An appreciation is sometimes called a **strengthening** of the currency, and a depreciation is sometimes called a **weakening** of the currency.

 The **real exchange rate** is the relative price of the goods of two countries.
$$
\epsilon \quad=\quad e \quad \times \quad\left(P / P^{*}\right)
$$

Note real exchange rate is nothing more than relative price. The lower the rate, the more the people will purchase fewer imported goods, which result in high $EX$.

The relationship can be described as:
$$
NX=NX(\epsilon)
$$
Turn attention back to nominal exchange rate, which is:
$$
e=\epsilon \frac{P^*}{P}
$$
Hence:
$$
\%\text{Change in } e=\%\text{Change in } \epsilon+\%\text{Change in } {P^*}-\%\text{Change in } P
$$
The percentage change in $P$ is the domestic inflation $\pi$.
$$
\%\text{Change in } e=\%\text{Change in } \epsilon+\pi^*-\pi
$$


> Law of one price:
>
> The same good cannot sell for different location at the same time.

The law of one price applied on the international marketplace is called **purchasing-power parity**.
