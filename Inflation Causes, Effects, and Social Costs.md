### Inflation: Causes, Effects, and Social Costs

The link between transactions and money is expressed in the following equation, called the **quantity equation**:
$$
M \times V = P \times T
$$
where $V$ is **velocity**, $P$ is **price** and $T$ is **Transactions**

V, called the **transactions velocity of money**, measures the rate at which money circulates in the economy.

When studying the role of money in the economy, $T$ is replaced by the total output of the economy $Y$
