### Inflation: Causes, Effects, and Social Costs

The link between transactions and money is expressed in the following equation, called the **quantity equation**:
$$
M \times V = P \times Y
$$
Where $P$ is the GDP deflator, $Y$ is real GDP, $V$is **income velocity of money**.

We defined **real money balance** as $\frac{M}{P}$, which describe the purchasing power of the money supply. 

Assumes $V$ is constant & exogenous
$$
V=\overline{V}
$$
then the quantity equation becomes a useful theory about the effects of money, called the
**quantity theory of money**.
$$
M \overline{V}=P Y
$$
We now have a theory to explain what determines the economy’s overall level of prices. The theory has three building blocks:

1. The factors of production and the production function determine the level of output $Y$.
2. The money supply $M$ set by the central bank determines the nominal value of output $P Y$. 
3. The price level $P$ is then the ratio of the nominal value of output $PY$ to the level of output $Y$.

the productive capability of the economy determines real GDP, the quantity of money determines nominal GDP, and the GDP deflator is the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP.
$$
\frac{\Delta M}{M}=\frac{\Delta P}{P}+\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}
$$
Let $\pi$ denotes the **inflation rate**:
$$
\pi=\frac{\Delta M}{M}-\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}
$$
The interest rate that the bank pays is called the **nominal interest rate**, the **real interest** is denoted by $r$:
$$
1+r=\frac{1+i}{1+\pi}\\
(1+r)(1+\pi)=1+i\\
1+r+\pi+\pi r=1+i
$$
Under normal circumstances, $\pi r$ is very small. So we obtain **Fisher equation**
$$
i=r+\pi
$$
Hence,an increase in *π* causes an equal increase in $i$, this relationship is called the **Fisher effect**

When a borrower and lender agree on a nominal interest rate, they do not know what the inflation rate over the term of the loan will be. Therefore, Let $\pi$ is **actual inflation rate**, $E\pi$ is **expected inflation rate**.

- **ex ante** $i-E\pi$
- **ex post** $i-\pi$

$i$ is the cost of holding money, so we write the general money demand function as:
$$
(M / P)^{d}=L(i, Y)=L(r+E\pi,Y)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned} \uparrow E \pi & \Rightarrow \uparrow \boldsymbol{i} \text { (the Fisher effect) } \\ & \Rightarrow \downarrow(\boldsymbol{M} / \boldsymbol{P})^{\mathrm{d}} \\ & \Rightarrow \uparrow \boldsymbol{P} \text { to make }(\boldsymbol{M} / \boldsymbol{P}) \text { fall } \\ & \text { to re-establish eq'm } \end{aligned}
$$
